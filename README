I'll take all notes comming from Udemy Course based on Github Actions.

# Section 1 Github Actions - Basic Building Blocks & Components

## Module Introduction

### Key Components (Workflow - Jobs & Steps)

Workflows Can be attached to all Guithub repositories, I can add as many I required

Workflows can include 1 or more jobs

Jobs Can contains 1 or more steps and here we can add all the strucutre we need to construct our code snippet

#### Workflow

- Attached to a Github repository
- Contain one or more Jobs
- Triggered upon Events (manually or Automatic after a new commits or new PR approved)

#### Jobs

- Define the Runner (execution Environment) Where do we're going to put our project or Website and set a agent to run, Windows, Linux MacOS
- Contain one or more Steps
- Can be run in Parallel or sequential
- Can be conditional

#### Steps

- Execute a code snipp or Action
- Can use custom or Third-party actions
- Steps are executed in order
- Can be conditional

### GitHub Actions: Availability & Pricing

In public repositories, you can use GitHub Actions for free. For private repositories, only a certain amount of monthly usage is available for free - extra usage on top must be paid.

The exact quotas and payment details depend on your GitHub plan, a detailed summary can be found here: https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions

If you can't find an "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository, you can should enable them as described here: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository

## Module Sumamry

### Core Components

- Workflows: Define Events + Jobs
- Jobs: Define Runner + Steps
- Steps: Do the actual work

### Events / Triggered

- Broad variety of events (repository-related & more)
- Workflows have at least one (possible more) event (s)

### Defining Workflows

- .github/workflows/<file>.yml (on Github or locally)
- Github Actions syntax must be followed

### Runners

- Servers(machines) that execute the jobs
- Pre-defined Runners (with different OS) exist
- You can create custom Runners

### Workflow Execution

- Workflow are execute when their events are triggered
- Github provides detailed insights into job execution (+logs)

### Actions

- You can run shell commands
- But you can use pre-defined Actions (official, community or custom)

## Exercise Time!

Download the Github repository and Create a 2 Workflows

1. Lint, Test & Deploy on "push"
- Run the "lint", "test" & "build" scripts
- Use One or Three jobs (running after each other)

2. Output Event Details on "issues"
- Output event details in the shell via "echo"
- Use the "issues" event & "github" context
